Now make all of that easy to use and a snap to **integrate into existing\r\napplications and frameworks**.  Make it **so easy I don't need to touch a single line of javascript to use it**. Now make it easy\r\nenough that **designers can modify the look, feel, *and behavior* of the application without needing to change a line of code**.\r\n\r\n##Show me some demos\r\n###Advanced Demo\r\n[MoshPit Messenger demo](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/demos/moshpit.messenger.html)\r\n===\r\n[javascript... scroll down.](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/docs/moshpit.messenger.html)\r\n | \r\n[LESS](https://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/less/moshpit.messenger.less)\r\n | \r\n[html](https://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/moshpit.messenger.html)  \r\nThis demo uses all of the features of `MoshPit.js` to build a mock messaging platform.  It uses `Backbone` for\r\n`Views`, `Models`, and `Collections` as well as generating data every time you start it up.  It has 2 user defined\r\nstates that you can use (one will make you hate yourself) and changes it's layout and functionality when\r\ndropping to a mobile/tablet mode.  It also has elements that are all dependent on one another for their own \r\nview state.  99% of the code is application code so I only highligthed the lines where `MoshPit.js` comes into play.\r\n\r\n###Simple Demos\r\n**What do these demos do?**\r\n\r\n*note: all of these demos do the same thing, but they all do it in diffent ways using various javascript implementations.*\r\n\r\n*note: make sure you resize your browser and flip panels around to see how they cope.*\r\n\r\n1. adjust to screen size changes without `@media` queries <sub>1</sub>\r\n2. modifies view styles to deal with conflicts <sub>2</sub>\r\n3. let's you apply an alternative view state on large screens <sub>3</sub>\r\n4. hides some controls based on screen size <sub>4</sub>\r\n5. on small screens the UI works to only show 1 panel at a time <sub>5</sub>\r\n\r\n<sub>1.1 you can still use `@media` queries and I actually think you *should*, they were omitted to reduce confusion.</sub>  \r\n<sub>2.1 views will consume as much space as we tell them to based on what views are currently shown</sub>  \r\n<sub>3.1 screen/layout sizes change styles and behavior of shown elements</sub>  \r\n<sub>4.1 the blue buttons won't be shown on smaller screens/layouts</sub>  \r\n<sub>5.1 we also hide controls to only show controls applicable to the functionality  \r\n(e.g. panel 2 can't be turned on without panel 1 being shown, panel 1 can't be hidden when panel 2 is shown, etc.)</sub>  \r\n\r\n###[no javascript demo](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/demos/demo.html)\r\n~~javascript~~ | [html](https://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/demo.html)  \r\nThis demo requires no javascript to be written.  It utilizes `data-moshpit` on HTML elements with \r\n`data-view` and `data-state` to tell `MoshPit.js` when and what it should be doing with a view.  \r\n*note: yes, it still requires javascript, but no additional javascript needed to be written to use `MoshPit.js`*\r\n\r\n###[1999 demo](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/demos/demo.vanilla.html)\r\n[javascript](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/docs/vanilla.html)\r\n | \r\n[html](https://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/demo.vanilla.html)  \r\nThis demo uses basic design patterns found in most applications, it uses `MoshPit.js` via it's global namespace \r\nfrom globally available functions.\r\n\r\n###[jquery.manual demo](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/demos/demo.jquery.html)\r\n[javascript](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/docs/jquery.html)\r\n | \r\n[html](https://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/demo.jquery.html)   \r\nThis demo uses generic/common jQuery implementations and jQuery `.on` events to communicate with `MoshPit.js` and\r\noperates inside of a privately scoped closure but relies on `MoshPit.js` global namespace.\r\n\r\n###[jquery.auto demo](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/demos/demo.jquery.auto.html)\r\n[javascript](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/docs/jquery.auto.html)\r\n | \r\n[html](https://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/demo.jquery.auto.html)  \r\nThis demo uses jQuery but it utilizes `MoshPit.join` to automate the tracking/handling of it's views.  It also\r\noperates inside of a privately scoped closure and does not rely on the `MoshPit` global beyond the initial `.join`\r\ncall to enable automated tracking/management.\r\n\r\n###[marionette demo](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/demos/demo.marionette.html)\r\n[javascript](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/docs/marionette.html)\r\n | \r\n[html](https://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/demo.marionette.html)  \r\nThis demo uses `Marionette` `Region`s and `ItemView`s and shows intergration with them via `MoshPit.join`.  \r\n*note: all of the other design patterns listed above can be used with `Marionette` design patterns too... if you're into that kind of thing.*\r\n\r\n##Let's talk some code.\r\nAs said all of our view management (position, size, colors, etc.) is all handled in CSS (where it should be!) and\r\nrelies on inheritence, chaining, and cascading to deal with conflicts.  With CSS it's a lot of extra typing (but possible\r\nif you're a masochist).  Using LESS however we greatly reduce the amount of code we have to write and we get nesting\r\nand chaining in a very intuitive format.  \r\n\r\n###[How can I start using this thing?](https://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/docs/usage.md)\r\nA quick run down of what you need to know if you'd like to start using `MoshPit`.\r\n\r\n###[Annotated source of MoshPit.js](http://chadillac.github.io/MoshPit.js/docs/moshpit.html)\r\nThis is an annotated version of the source code.  \r\n*note: [docco is awesome.](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/)*\r\n\r\n###[LESS file used in MoshPit Messenger](http://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/less/moshpit.messenger.less)\r\nThis is the LESS file that was parsed via `lessc` to produce the final CSS file use in MoshPit Messenger demo.\r\n\r\n###[LESS file used in all of the Simple demos](http://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/less/demo.less)\r\nThis is the LESS file that was parsed via `lessc` to produce the final CSS file used in all of the demos.\r\n\r\n###[CSS file used in all of the Simple demos](https://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/demo.css)\r\nThis is the results from the LESS file above after processing with `lessc`.\r\n\r\n###[CSS file used in all of the MoshPit Messenger demo](https://github.com/chadillac/MoshPit.js/blob/master/demos/moshpit.messenger.css)\r\nThis is the results from the LESS file above after processing with `lessc`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
